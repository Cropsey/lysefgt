# Learn You Some eBPF for Greater Good

Ready for a delightful skim over the vast ocean of eBPF, Go, ELF, and DWARF? If you've ever been intrigued by the enigmatic inner workings of your Go programs, this workshop serves as an entertaining and friendly starting point for your exploration.

In this workshop, we will:
* Touch on a small, yet relevant subset of eBPF that connects with our workshop theme.
* Learn the basics of constructing a profiler, with a focus on Go binaries for now.
* Gain a beginner's insight into performance measurement and optimization.

You'll have the opportunity to incrementally construct your own profiler using eBPF, Go, and a chosen mix of libraries and packages. By the end, you'll gain a clearer understanding of your code's low-level operations and be better equipped to identify potential areas for improvement.

Wondering why we are building a profiler from scratch? Constructing from the ground up provides a unique learning opportunity. By engaging with each line of code - whether it's writing or reading - you'll cultivate a deeper understanding of profilers, including how they interact with your programs.

So, ready to dive into the byte pool and make a splash in your system programming skills?
